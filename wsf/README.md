# Washington State Ferries (WSF) Schedule App

This plan has little use in itself (unless you commute between Bainbridge Island and Seattle),
the purpose however is to demonstrate the simplest possible example of building a Go application
from source, rather than packaging the pre-built binary.

The source of the app and details on how to use it are found here:
